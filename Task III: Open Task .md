# Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning-

Quantum Computing helps us to extend the set of physical laws computer act upon by accessing quantum aspects of physical world.One of the very important phenomenon which allows quantum computers to access many possibilites at
once is superposition.However the issue with quantum computing is to develop a scalable and fault tolerant device on which we can implement all the quantum algorithms.An issue is that the existing quantum hardware are either small or noisy.Quantum devices for useful algorithms require error correction, and architectures that can correct errors faster than they occur are called fault-tolerant.One of the things that caught my eye recently was Google's supressing the quantum errors by scaling code on logical qubit.
